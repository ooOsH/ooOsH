### Hi there 👋, my name is ooOsH

👋 I'm a South London based frontend engineer utilising modern JS frameworks tooling to build beautiful user experiences (and occasionally designing them too)
🍝 In my spare time I'm cooking up creative ideas at the [Spaghetti Supper Club](https://spaghettisupper.club)
🌱 I’m currently making cool things with Nuxt JS
